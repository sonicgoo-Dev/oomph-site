 * FAQs for pages built on the service-page.php template.

 * ACF empty on /luxury-cruise-planning/, that left six visible Q&As with no
 * structured data behind them.
 *
 * Holding the copy here makes it the page's content of record rather than a
 * fallback, so the visible <details> markup and the JSON-LD render from one
 * array and can't drift. ACF still wins when populated — the plugin reads
 * `service_faqs` before it reaches this filter, and so does the template.
 *
 * Schema safety: this content is what renders on the page, so claiming it
 * satisfies "never mark up content not visible on the page" (docs/schema.md).
