 *
 * Every form asks the same four things — first name and email required, last
 * name and phone optional — so a contact arrives with as much as they chose to
 * give, wherever they signed up. Only the two are enforced; the other two are
 * marked optional in the label (R39) rather than demanded, which keeps the form
 * short enough to finish. Plainsend stores whatever arrives and never insists
 * on more than the address.
