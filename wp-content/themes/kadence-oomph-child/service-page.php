 *   • §1 ghost CTA "Send me the cabin guide" — pending lead-magnet
 *     system.
 *
 * Primary CTA "Start a conversation →" appears in the hero, after the
 * deliverables grid, after the "why advisor" section, and in the final
 * CTA block (four placements + sticky mobile bar = five surfaces).
 *
 * Schema (Service + FAQPage) is injected sitewide by the
 * oomph-travel-core plugin's class-schema.php, conditional on this
 * template slug. No schema is output here.
