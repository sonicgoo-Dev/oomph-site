			<p class="oomph-eyebrow">One advisor</p>
			<h2 id="why-title">Why I do this.</h2>
			<p>I started planning other people's trips because I'd been keeping spreadsheets for my own for years. Cabin numbers, deck plans, the restaurant in Lecce my brother-in-law wouldn't stop asking about. Eventually a friend asked me to plan a Mediterranean cruise for their thirtieth anniversary. They came home and told four people. That was the whole start of it.</p>

					<p>Anniversaries, retirements, the trip you've talked about for ten years. The kind that has to land — choose the right cabin, get the dinner reservations, pace the days so neither of you comes home tired. I plan milestone trips because I've planned my own; the ones you only get a couple of in a lifetime deserve someone who has been there.</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h3 class="oomph-card__headline">Families planning across three generations.</h3>
					<p>Three generations, one wheelchair, three picky eaters. Mobility, dietary, room configurations, a plan B for weather — a hundred small decisions, not one big one. I serve multi-gen families because they remind me of my own, and because the trip works or it doesn't. There's no middle ground.</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h3 class="oomph-card__headline">Cruisers planning what's next.</h3>
					<p>You've sailed the mainstream lines and you're curious what ultra-luxury is actually like. I've sailed fourteen Silversea voyages. I'll tell you what's worth it, what isn't, and which cabin categories overdeliver — and which ones quietly disappoint.</p>

					<p>Cabin selection, itinerary, transfers, dinner reservations — the small details that make a trip feel choreographed. You see one proposal because I do the narrowing for you. Revisions are part of the process; the goal is a plan we both agree on before any money changes hands.</p>

					<p>If something changes — a delayed flight, a closed restaurant, a sudden chance to do something better — I'm reachable. The point of an advisor isn't the planning; it's the person on call when the day shifts. I stay on your trip until you're back home.</p>
