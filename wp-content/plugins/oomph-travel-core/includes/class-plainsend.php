/**
 * Plainsend — newsletter signup, posted to our own email app.
 *
 * The signup form's markup lives in the child theme, because it is
 * presentation. What lives here is the part that must survive a theme
 * switch and must differ per environment: which app the form posts to,
 * and which form it posts to there.
 *
 * Why not a plugin embed or an iframe. Plainsend serves a hosted page that
 * could be framed, but a frame is a second document with its own stylesheet
 * on a site that has just spent an LCP workstream removing 43 KB of form CSS,
 * and it cannot inherit the brand tokens. Native markup posting across
 * origins costs nothing extra to render and looks like the rest of the page.
 *
 * The form works with JavaScript switched off: it posts and the visitor lands
 * on a thank-you page at Plainsend. The script below is the enhancement that
 * keeps them on oomphtravel.com instead.
 *
 * @package OomphTravel\Core
