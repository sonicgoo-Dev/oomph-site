/**
 * The advisor identity — one source of truth for who wrote the site.
 *
 * Everything that names Eric on the front end (the journal byline, the Person
 * node in the JSON-LD @graph, the bio block on /about) reads from here, and
 * this reads from the WordPress user record. Editing the profile screen is
 * therefore enough to change the name and bio everywhere; no deploy needed.
 *
 * Before 2026-08 the name lived as a literal 'Eric Hempel' in
 * Schema::person() and in the theme's single.php, which is why updating the
 * user profile changed nothing on the front end.
 *
 * Which user? In order:
 *   1. Whatever `oomph_advisor_user_id` returns, if anything.
 *   2. The lowest-numbered administrator — the site owner on a solo site.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT the current post's author: the BlogPosting node points its
 * `author` at the single `/about/#advisor` @id, so a byline that tracked
 * post_author could disagree with the schema and split the author entity in
 * search — the exact thing this class exists to prevent. A genuine second
 * author would need its own Person node, not a different display name on the
 * same @id.
 *
