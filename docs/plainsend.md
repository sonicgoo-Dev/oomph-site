# Plainsend — newsletter signup

Newsletter signups on this site go to **Plainsend**, Eric's own email app, which
sends through his own Amazon SES account. Repo: `~/projects/PlainSend`. App:
<https://app.plainsend.net>.

This replaced a Fluent Forms embed in the sitewide footer on 2026-08-12.

## Why it is not an embed or an iframe

The Fluent Forms newsletter form brought **43 KB of stylesheet to every page on
the site** for one email field, and because it sat in the sitewide footer there
was no page without it — which blocked the conditional-dequeue fix the
2026-07-28 LCP audit called for.

An iframe would have been no better: a second document with its own render-
blocking CSS, unable to inherit the brand tokens, so it would look like another
company's form dropped into the page.

What is there now is **plain markup in the child theme**, using `.oomph-field`
and `.oomph-btn` like every other form here, posting across origins to
Plainsend. It adds no stylesheet and no plugin.

## How it works

| Piece | Where | Why there |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Endpoint and form slug | `oomph-travel-core/includes/class-plainsend.php` | Environment-aware, so it belongs in the plugin and survives a theme switch |
| Markup | `oomphtravel/inc/template-tags.php` (`oomphtravel_signup_form()`) | One helper for every surface — footer, Journal, Travel Trends — so the honeypot and timing field cannot go missing from a copy. The retired child theme's `oomph_signup_form()` is no longer called by anything live |
| Call sites | `oomphtravel/patterns/footer.php`, `journal-index.php`, `travel-trends.php` | Presentation |
| Styles | `oomphtravel/assets/css/components.css` (`.ot-signup`) | Presentation |
| Submit script | `oomphtravel/assets/js/newsletter.js` | ~1 KB, deferred, no dependencies |

> **2026-10-03: the four fields were put back.** The rebuilt theme launched on
> 15 September with a form of its own that asked for the email address only,
> so every signup from then until this fix arrived in PlainSend without a name.
> `oomphtravel_signup_form()` now asks for the same four fields described
> below, and `tests/ci/editorial.spec.ts` asserts them on the Travel Trends
> page and in the footer.

**What each form asks for.** First name and email address, both required, then
last name and phone number, both optional and marked so in the label (R39).
Plainsend stores whatever arrives and enforces only the address. A phone number
is kept exactly as typed and never texted — it is there for Eric to reach a
lead by hand.

> This is a deliberate exception to **R43** ("lead-magnet landing pages: single
> email field only"). The decision, 2026-08-24, was that a first name is worth
> the friction everywhere because it makes every later email personal, and that
> the optional last name and phone cost nothing to offer. If a future lead-magnet
> page needs to be lean again, `oomph_signup_form()` is the one place to add a
> field-set argument.

**It works with JavaScript switched off.** The markup is a real `<form>` with a
real `action`, so without the script it posts and the visitor lands on a
thank-you page at Plainsend. The form carries no `novalidate`, so the browser
enforces the two required fields and the email format before it posts, with or
without the script. The script is the enhancement that keeps them here instead.

**Nothing per-request is in the markup.** SG Optimizer serves cached pages, so a
PHP nonce or server timestamp would be the cached one. Everything the anti-spam
checks need is set by the script or held by Plainsend.

## Environments

`Plainsend::form_slug()` sends production to the `newsletter` form and
staging/local to `newsletter-staging`. Both are real submissions against the
real app — that is the point of testing — but test signups land somewhere that
can be emptied without touching a subscriber.

Filters, if either ever needs to move: `oomph_plainsend_app_url`,
`oomph_plainsend_form_slug`.

## What Plainsend does that the old form did not

- **Double opt-in.** A signup is `pending` until the person clicks a link in a
  confirmation email. Nobody joins the list without proving the address.
- **Working unsubscribe**, one click, no login, plus the one-click header Gmail
  and Yahoo require of bulk senders.
- **Automatic suppression.** An address that hard-bounces or reports spam is
  removed within seconds and never emailed again.

The old form had none of these. It emailed Eric a notification and left the
address in the WordPress database.

## The one setting outside this repo

Plainsend refuses cross-origin posts from sites not on its allowlist — an open
endpoint would let any website on the internet spend the sending budget. On
Render, the Plainsend service needs:

```
FORM_ORIGINS=https://oomphtravel.com,https://www.oomphtravel.com
```

Add the staging hostname too while testing there. Without this, submissions
from the site are refused with a 403.

## Testing it

The Playwright smoke suite deliberately never submits forms. To check the
signup path by hand on staging: submit a real address, confirm the email
arrives, click the button in it, and check the contact turns from `pending` to
`subscribed` in Plainsend under **Forms & pages**.

Note that Plainsend is still in the **Amazon SES sandbox** (support case
`178643233200952`) — until that is lifted, confirmation emails only reach
addresses verified with Amazon.
