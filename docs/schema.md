# Schema Markup Library

JSON-LD blocks, one per page type. Drop into the page `<head>` via Rank Math's "Custom Schema" or via the child theme's `functions.php`. Test every block in [Google's Rich Results Test](https://search.google.com/test/rich-results) before merging.

**Universal rules:**
- Use `@id` URLs that match the actual page URL (with `#organization`, `#person`, etc. fragments for entity linking).
- Pages with structured data are 3.2× more likely to be cited in AI Overviews.
- Never mark up content not visible on the page (Google considers this a violation).
- Update `dateModified` on every meaningful edit.

## Organization — sitewide (in `<head>` of every page via theme)

## Person — advisor bio (on `/about` and referenced sitewide)

> **Driven by the WordPress user record (2026-08).** `name`, `jobTitle`,
> `description`, and `knowsAbout` are no longer literals in
> `class-schema.php` — they come from `OomphTravel\Core\Advisor`, which reads
> the advisor's user profile (Users → Profile): **Display name** → `name`,
> **Biographical Info** → `description`. Editing the profile screen updates the
> byline on journal posts, the biography block on `/about`, and this node
> together. `description` is omitted entirely when Biographical Info is empty,
> so the node never claims copy that isn't on the page.
>
> `jobTitle` (`["Luxury Travel Advisor","Physician"]`) and `knowsAbout` have no
> profile field behind them; change them via the `oomph_advisor_job_title` /
> `oomph_advisor_knows_about` filters. The `@id` stays
> `https://oomphtravel.com/about/#advisor` whatever the display name becomes —
> every `BlogPosting.author` points at it.

> **No planning fee (locked 2026-07-03, see BUILD-PLAN.md).** Eric does not charge one — never emit an Offer/OfferCatalog implying a fee. Fee framing on pages is commission-based / no-added-cost.

## FAQPage — required on every service hub and pillar guide

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Cruise lines publish thousands of cabins; only a handful are right for you. An advisor knows the deck plans, the noise patterns, the suite categories that overdeliver, and the ones that quietly disappoint."
      }
    },

      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "Do you charge a planning fee?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "No — my planning costs you nothing. Cruise lines pay commissions on the booked fare, and those commissions don't change your price."

## Implementation notes for Claude Code

When generating a new page, output the JSON-LD into the page's "Custom Schema" panel in Rank Math. Do not hardcode `@id` URLs that include placeholders — always substitute the real published URL. After publishing, paste the rendered URL into the Rich Results Test and confirm zero errors before declaring the page done.
